Statistical Analysis to Estimate confidence intervals for the difference between means, proportions, and the ratio of variances in the Storms dataset to explore changes in mean latitude, proportions of storm classifications, and variability in pressure data over different years.

Task 1
Estimating the confidence interval (CI) for the difference between two population means of the Latitude of the storm between the years 1975 and 1991.

Task 2
Estimating the confidence interval (CI) for the difference between two population proportions of storms classified as tropical depression in 2020 and tropical storm in 2021.

Task 3
Estimating the confidence interval (CI) for the Ratio of Two Population Variances of the air pressure at the stormâ€™s center between the years 1999 and 2000.
